# dock-your-journal

A containerized version of my mean-community-journal project - I docked the Angular app & Express server into a single container, and the Mongo database into another container.

I learned Docker imaging, containerization, processes, docker-compose with environment variables, and container communication.

# Build

Run `docker-compose up --build` to build the app.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in any browser to use it.
